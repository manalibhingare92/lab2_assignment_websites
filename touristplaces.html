    <h1>Tourist Places in Pune</h1>

    <h2>Agakhan Palace</h2>
    <p>Spread over 13 acres, the palace itself occupies seven acres. 
       The palace is beautiful in its architecture with many Islamic influences 
       with a touch of Italian architecture. The building comprises five halls and large verandahs. 
       In March 2003, Aga Khan Palace was declared a ‘monument of national importance’ by the 
       Archaeological Survey Of India. The palace is also popular for couples looking to get
       great pre-wedding photoshoots done.</p>

    <h2>Shanivarwada</h2>
    <p>
       Built in 1732, it was the great seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818. 
       Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the center of Indian politics in the 18th century. 
       The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but 
       the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.</p>

    <h2>Sinhagad Fort</h2>
    <p>It is located in the Pune district in Maharashtra. 
       The fort is also one of the most famous forts in Maharashtra and has a great history associated with Tanaji Malusare. 
       The fort was captured by Tanaji Malusare and his brother. Sinhagad (Lion's Fort) was strategically 
       built to provide natural protection from enemies due to its very steep slopes. 
       The walls of the forts and bastions were constructed only at key places. 
       There are two gates to enter the fort named Kalyan Darwaja and Pune Darwaza. 
       The Kalyan Darwaja is towards the southeast while the Pune Darwaza is towards the northeast.</p>

    <h2>Isckon Temple</h2>
    <p>The temple complex has two temples - the main Radha Krishna temple and the Venkateswara (Balaji) temple. 
       The Radha Krishna temple is built in the North Indian architectural style using red stone and marble while the 
       Venkateswara temple is built in the South Indian architectural style (similar to the Balaji temple in Tirumala) 
       using Kota stone.</p>
